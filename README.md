# LOAN-APPLICATION-EDA

This project centers on the comprehensive analysis and preprocessing of a financial dataset titled 'application_data.csv.' The primary focus is to prepare the data for further analysis and modeling by addressing various data quality issues that could impact the results.

The initial phase involves meticulous handling of missing values. This includes removing any columns that contain more than 50% missing data, as these are unlikely to provide reliable insights. For columns with fewer missing entries, appropriate imputation methods are employed to fill in the gaps, ensuring that the dataset remains robust and usable.

In addition to managing missing values, the project also identifies and addresses outliers that may skew the analysis. Outliers can often indicate anomalies or errors in data entry, and their presence can significantly affect statistical outcomes. Techniques for detecting and managing these outliers are applied to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

Following these preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. This involves visualizing both numerical and categorical variables to better understand their distributions and interactions. Various visualization tools, such as histograms, box plots, and bar charts, are utilized to illustrate key findings.

During the EDA, several noteworthy insights emerge. For instance, it appears that marital status has a significant influence on the likelihood of fulfilling annuity payments. Additionally, the analysis reveals that cash loans tend to be repaid more consistently than revolving loans, indicating potential differences in borrower behavior. Another observation is that laborers constitute the largest group of individuals applying for loans, which could inform lending strategies and risk assessments.

Ultimately, the project aims to not only derive meaningful insights from the dataset but also to ensure it is adequately prepared for subsequent analysis or modeling efforts. By thoroughly preprocessing the data and conducting exploratory analysis, this project sets the stage for more advanced financial modeling and predictive analytics.
